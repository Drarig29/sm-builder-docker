# sm-builder

This repository generates a Docker image providing [sm-builder](https://github.com/splewis/sm-builder), which is a build/package tool to compile SourceMod plugins.

Thanks to this image, you don't have anymore to:

- Have the Dockerfile in your project.
- Have a `smbuild` file in your project.
- Have a `.gitmodules` file in your project.
- Build the image yourself.

Just go in your SourceMod plugin's root folder, and run the following:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src -v $(pwd)/out:/out sm-builder:latest
```

A common plugin structure is:

```
scripting/

  include/
      * get5.inc

  * your_plugin.sp

* LICENSE
* README.md
```

## Requirements

- Docker ðŸ˜Ž

- If you don't have a `smbuild` file:

  - You need to have a single `.sp` file in the `scripting/` folder.
  - You need to have a `LICENSE` and a `README.md`.

## Thanks ðŸ’—

- To [@splewis](https://github.com/splewis) for his amazing build tool.
- To [@Apfelwurm](https://github.com/Apfelwurm) for his work on https://github.com/splewis/get5/pull/572 and https://github.com/splewis/get5/pull/587 to create the original version of the Dockerfile for [get5](https://github.com/splewis/get5).
